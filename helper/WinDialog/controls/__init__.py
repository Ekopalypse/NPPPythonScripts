"""
Dialog Control Implementation Module

This module provides the implementation of controls used in a dialog.
It includes a base class `Control` that serves as the foundation for specific controls such as buttons, labels, and more.

The `Control` class provides common attributes and methods for controls, including properties for control size, position,
style, and window class. It also offers a `create()` method to generate the control template structure.

Subclasses of `Control` represent different types of controls such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
Each subclass inherits from `Control` and adds control-specific functionality and properties.

The module also includes enums and constants related to control styles, messages, and notifications.
